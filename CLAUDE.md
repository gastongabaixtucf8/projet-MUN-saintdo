# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Website for the **MUN Saint Dominique** conference (Institut Saint Dominique, Pau). Conference dates: 19–21 March 2027. Stack: **Next.js 15** (App Router, React 19) + **Tailwind CSS** + **Sanity** (CMS) + **Vercel** (hosting).

Six pages (Home, About, MUN 2027, Pau & Travel, Gallery, Contact) plus a shared Header and Footer. Most content is hardcoded in the page components; Sanity powers the gallery photos, the programme PDF, and the committee topics PDF.

## Live URLs

- **Website (public):** https://projet-mun-saintdo.vercel.app — auto-deploys on every push to `main` (Vercel Git integration). This is the link to share.
- **Sanity Studio (admin, login required):** https://munsaintdo.sanity.studio — where admins manage photos/PDFs. Deploy it with `cd studio && npx sanity deploy`.
- The old WordPress site at `mun.saintdominique.fr` is **separate and unrelated** to this project.

## Git workflow

After every file edit, Claude automatically runs `git add -A && git commit -m "auto-save" && git push origin main` via a PostToolUse hook in `.claude/settings.json`. Pushing to `main` triggers a production deploy on Vercel.

## Development

```bash
# Web app (Next.js) — runs on localhost:3000
npm run dev

# Sanity Studio — runs on localhost:3333
cd studio && npm run dev

# Deploy the Studio (after schema/structure changes)
cd studio && npx sanity deploy
```

## Environment variables

The Sanity project is already created (project ID `3pjewoqe`) and both env files are filled in.

**Web app** — `.env.local` at the root:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=3pjewoqe
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=   # contact form delivery (see below)
```

The contact form (`components/ContactForm.tsx`) sends submissions to `mun@saintdominique.fr` via [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com). Get a free access key for that address and set it in `.env.local` and in the Vercel project env vars. Until the key is set, the form shows an error on submit.

**Studio** — `studio/.env`:
```
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=3pjewoqe
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET=production
```

## How content works

Most page content is hardcoded in the `app/**/page.tsx` files — to change copy, edit the JSX. Sanity drives the following, all editable in the Studio (login required) and live without a redeploy:

- **Gallery photos** — `/gallery` fetches `*[_type == "galleryPhoto"] | order(_createdAt desc)`. Studio → **Gallery Photos**. The `GalleryGrid` client component shows a click-to-enlarge lightbox (full-res `unoptimized` image).
- **Programme PDF / Committee Topics PDF / Delegate Guide PDF** — `/mun2027` fetches the `programDocument`, `committeeTopicsDocument`, and `delegateGuideDocument` singletons. Studio → the matching item. Programme/Committee Topics show "Coming Soon" until uploaded; the Delegate Guide falls back to the static `/delegates-guide.pdf`.
- **Organising committee** — `components/OrganisingCommittee.tsx` (used on `/mun2027`) fetches `*[_type == "committeeMember"] | order(order asc)`. Studio → **Organising Committee**. Admins edit each member's photo, name, role, quote, and order. If Sanity has no members, the component falls back to the 5 hardcoded members.

To **replace a PDF**, edit the file field on the existing singleton and Publish — do NOT delete the document (the Delete action is disabled on PDF singletons to prevent the Studio getting stuck in a deleted/read-only state).

## Sanity schema

Document types: `galleryPhoto` (image + caption), `programDocument` / `committeeTopicsDocument` / `delegateGuideDocument` (single PDF `file`, used as singletons), and `committeeMember` (name, role, photo, quote, order). The old test `siteSettings` type was removed. `sanity.config.ts` disables `delete`/`duplicate` for the PDF singleton types.

**Gotcha — document ids must not contain a dot.** The newest Sanity API treats an id like `committee.mathilda` as a *release/version* (`<release>.<base>`), which is **invisible to the anonymous/published perspective** the live site uses (the Studio still shows it, so it looks fine in admin but is missing on the site). Always use dot-free ids (e.g. `committee-mathilda`). When seeding documents, `sanity documents create <file> --replace` takes **one JSON object per call** (loop line by line); multi-line ndjson fails to parse.

## Design / theme

Tailwind custom theme (`tailwind.config.js`):
- `navy-dark` `#0e1f42` — header + footer (the darkest anchor)
- `navy` `#1f4280` — page heroes, CTA sections, headings
- `navy-mid` `#34609f`, `navy-light` `#5180c5` — accents/hovers
- `gold` `#c9a84c` — accent

Other notes:
- **Header**: a solid white top bar (navy social circles + gold "Apply on MyMUN") that scrolls away, plus two frosted "liquid-glass" pills (logo + nav) that are sticky and follow on scroll. Glass = `bg-white/65 backdrop-blur-md border-2 border-gray-400/80`. The logo's globe overflows its pill.
- **Rounded sections**: big colored/photo bands use `rounded-[2rem]` (or `rounded-t`/`rounded-b` where they touch another colored band, to avoid white notches between two adjacent navy sections).
- Reusable classes in `globals.css`: `.btn-primary`, `.btn-outline`, `.btn-white`, `.nav-link`, `.card`, `.form-input`, `.section-title`, `.page-hero`.

## Caching & replacing images

- Pages and local media are served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` (see `next.config.ts` `headers()`), so visitors always get the latest version without a forced refresh.
- **When replacing an image, give it a NEW filename** (e.g. `pau.jpg` → `pau-2.jpg`) and update the reference. The Next.js image optimizer caches optimized images by source URL, so reusing the same filename can still serve the old picture. A new filename guarantees the new image shows.

## Key content facts

- Conference dates: 19, 20 & 21 March 2027
- Registration: via MyMUN (`mymun.com`)
- Partner school: Alleyn's School, London (`alleynsmun.co.uk`)
- Venue: 30 Avenue Fouchet, 64000 Pau
- Official travel partner: **Pro Sky** (`pro-sky.com`) — page Pau lists email + phone contacts for two regions.
- The MUN 2027 page no longer lists a per-committee section or a "Language" field. The conference theme is still to be announced.
- The organising committee shown is the 2025–2026 team; the 2027 committee is confirmed in September 2026.

## Writing rules

- **Never use emojis** anywhere in the codebase — not in JSX, not in text content, not in comments. Use SVG icons or plain text labels instead.
- No comments in code unless the reason is non-obvious.
- All site content is in English.
