# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

Website for the **MUN Saint Dominique** conference (Institut Saint Dominique, Pau). Conference dates: 19–21 March 2027. Stack: **Next.js 15** (App Router, React 19) + **Sanity** (CMS) + **Vercel** (hosting).

The site is live and built out: six real pages (Home, About, MUN 2027, Pau & Travel, Gallery, Contact) plus a shared Header and Footer. Most content is hardcoded in the page components; Sanity currently powers only the gallery photos and the programme PDF.

## Git workflow

After every file edit, Claude automatically runs `git add -A && git commit -m "auto-save" && git push origin main` via a PostToolUse hook in `.claude/settings.json`. No manual commits needed.

## Development

```bash
# Web app (Next.js) — runs on localhost:3000
npm run dev

# Sanity Studio — runs on localhost:3333
cd studio && npm run dev
```

## Environment variables

The Sanity project is already created (project ID `3pjewoqe`) and both env files are filled in.

**Web app** — `.env.local` at the root:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=3pjewoqe
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY=   # contact form delivery (see below)
```

The contact form (`components/ContactForm.tsx`) sends submissions to `mun@saintdominique.fr` via [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com). Get a free access key for that address and set it in `.env.local` and in the Vercel project env vars. Until the key is set, the form will show an error on submit.

**Studio** — `studio/.env`:
```
SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID=3pjewoqe
SANITY_STUDIO_DATASET=production
```

The Sanity project ID is found at sanity.io/manage → your project → Settings.

## How content works

Most page content is hardcoded directly in the `app/**/page.tsx` files — to change copy, edit the JSX. Sanity drives two things only:

- **Gallery photos** — `/gallery` fetches `*[_type == "galleryPhoto"] | order(_createdAt desc)`. Admins add photos in the Studio under **Gallery Photos**.
- **Programme PDF** — `/mun2027` fetches the `programDocument` singleton (`_id == "programme-singleton"`). Admins upload the PDF in the Studio under **Programme PDF**. Shows "Coming Soon" until uploaded.

The `siteSettings` "message" field is leftover scaffolding from the initial test and is not used anywhere on the site.

## Sanity schema

Three document types: `galleryPhoto` (image + optional caption), `programDocument` (single PDF file, used as a singleton), and `siteSettings` (legacy, unused). Future content types may include committee members and richer page content.

## Design / theme

- Tailwind with a custom theme: `navy` (`#0e1f42`), `navy-mid`, `navy-light`, and `gold` (`#c9a84c`) accent.
- Reusable classes in `globals.css`: `.btn-primary`, `.btn-outline`, `.btn-white`, `.nav-link`, `.card`, `.form-input`, `.section-title`, `.page-hero`.

- The organising committee currently shown on `/about` is the 2025–2026 team; the 2027 committee is confirmed in September 2026.

## Caching & replacing images

- Pages and local media are served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` (see `next.config.ts` `headers()`), so visitors always get the latest version without a forced refresh.
- **When replacing an image, give it a NEW filename** (e.g. `pau.jpg` → `pau-2.jpg`) and update the reference. The Next.js image optimizer caches optimized images by source URL, so reusing the same filename can still serve the old picture. A new filename guarantees the new image shows.

## Writing rules

- **Never use emojis** anywhere in the codebase — not in JSX, not in text content, not in comments. Use SVG icons or plain text labels instead.
- No comments in code unless the reason is non-obvious.
- All site content is in English.
